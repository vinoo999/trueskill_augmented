    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Trueskill, developed by Microsoft Research, is a general skill based ranking system based upon a prior distribution around a player's mean skill and variance (Herbrich, Minka, Graepel). The original system models an player's skill, variance in performance, and uses an Expectation Propogation algorithm to update a player's skill representation and variance for every new game that the player participates in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project fifaskill, we attempt to extend the Trueskill method to FIFA games, with the aim of modeling a team's overall skill and predicting future matches. We adapt from Trueskill methods because Expectation Propagation and message passing algorithms are not ideally implemented in edward. We experiment with modeling offense and defense skills seperately, as well as home team advantage."

Because Champions League data is not present in this dataset, we evaluate leagues one at a time rather than jointly as we had originally hoped. The query we will use is focused on the English Premier League but can be trivially modified to any other country league by specifying the country in the query.   \n",

We draw the below image from his notebook analysis to demonstrate this fact.  \n",

Our weight matrix $W \\sim \\mathcal{N}(25, \\frac{25}{3} ^ 2)$ is a $d \\times 1$ matrix denoting the skill of each team. Thus $XW$ outputs $Y$, a $m$ dimensional vector denoting the difference in skill levels of the two teams. Our supervised approach uses $Y$ as the goal differences for that particular match."

Each team also has a variable offense and defense performance, based off the corrosponding skill, similar to how skill and performance were related in the basic model. We further now make the assertion that since we are modeling a discrete variable - goals - that we will use a Poisson distribution to model the goals scored. Based on the offense and defense performance, we draw from a Poisson distribution twice to determine the number of goals scored and number of goals allowed. We center the Gaussian prior to the standard normal in order to better account for a goals scored/allowed prior.\n",
