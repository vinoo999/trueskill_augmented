    "\n",
    "Trueskill, developed by Microsoft Research, is a general skill based ranking system based upon a prior distribution around a player's mean skill and variance (Herbrich, Minka, Graepel). The original system models an player's skill, variance in performance, and uses an Expectation Propogation algorithm to update a player's skill representation and variance for every new game that the player participates in.\n",

    "In our project fifaskill, we extend the Trueskill method to FIFA games, with the aim of modeling a team's overall skill and predicting future matches. We begin with the basic true skill model, and experiment with modeling offense and defense skills seperately, as well as home team advantage. "
